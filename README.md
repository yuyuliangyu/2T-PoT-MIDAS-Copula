# 2T-PoT-MIDAS-Copula
this code is used to construct a 2T-PoT-MIDAS-Copula model to predict volatility marginally and VaR in joint

 We proposes a dynamic two-tailed peak over threshold (2T-PoT) model
 based on the dynamic bivariate peak over threshold model. The proposed model
 has a double-tailed distribution with Pareto behavior. We combine the extended
 model with the GARCH-MIDAS model for out-of-sample volatility forecasting. The
 empirical results show that the extended model has better volatility forecasting ability
 than the original dynamic PoT model. Further, we define a 2PoT-GAS-Copula model
 similar to PoT-GAS-Copula, and the performance of the former in predicting VaR is
 consistent with the latter, illustrating the reliability of the new model.
